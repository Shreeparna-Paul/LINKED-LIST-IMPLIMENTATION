**This project is a command-line based C program that implements a singly linked list, allowing users to dynamically insert, delete, and traverse nodes using a simple interactive menu. It is built using the C programming language, a low-level procedural language widely used in system programming, operating systems, and embedded development. The code uses fundamental C features such as struct for defining the linked list node, malloc() and free() for dynamic memory management, pointer manipulation for linking nodes, and standard input/output operations through scanf() and printf(). The program is cross-platform and can be compiled and executed on Windows, Linux, or macOS, using any standard C compiler like GCC, MinGW, Clang, or even Turbo C++ for academic environments. This makes it an ideal project for students learning data structures or preparing for practical exams. The source code can be written and edited using popular text editors and IDEs such as Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, CLion, or even lightweight tools like Notepad++. The menu-driven interface allows the user to select from options like inserting a node at the end of the list, deleting a node by value, and traversing the entire list to view its contents. This interactivity makes it suitable for educational demonstrations and classroom assignments. Beyond academic purposes, this code also serves as a solid foundation for developers looking to understand how low-level memory manipulation works in C. By studying the logic behind how nodes are dynamically created and linked together, learners can build a stronger understanding of more advanced data structures like stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Moreover, this linked list logic is also applicable in real-world scenarios such as managing dynamic datasets in embedded systems, creating custom memory pools, or building event/message queues in resource-constrained environments. The code also includes basic input validation, ensuring robustness against invalid entries, and handles corner cases such as deleting a node that doesnâ€™t exist or trying to traverse an empty list. This kind of implementation helps build strong fundamentals in algorithmic thinking and pointer-based logic. Additionally, since the program does not rely on any platform-specific libraries or advanced system calls, it can be easily ported or compiled across various platforms without modification. Its simplicity makes it ideal for use in coding interviews, technical assessments, or as a starting point for more complex C projects involving linked data. The clear use of functions (insert(), delete_node(), and traverse()) promotes modular programming and reusability, while the main function (main()) demonstrates a practical use of control structures like loops and switch-case statements. Overall, this program not only provides hands-on experience in working with dynamic memory and pointers but also instills best practices in writing clean, structured, and portable C code. It is a great project for anyone aiming to strengthen their understanding of linked lists or preparing for courses and interviews that involve data structure implementation from scratch**
